chat v0.1.5
===========

A chat test made with nodejs and socket.io.

To run, you have to install the node modules:

```js
npm install express
npm install swig
npm install socket.io
```

And change the value of the property "app.DNS" in /public/js/chat.js to your custom value, and the DNS to get "/socket.io/socket.io.js" in /views/chat.html.

If you want, change the port number in "/server.js".
